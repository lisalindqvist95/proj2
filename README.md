# Crystal Universe
## About
Crystal Universe is a site with fun but silly features to entertain the user. The site is targeted towards anyone who enjoys fortune telling in popular culture like tarot readings, fortune cookies or magic 8-balls. This idea is based on the popularity of similar filters on TikTok where the user can receive a randomized answer, letter or number as well as the rise of tarot readers on social media. The site contains features where the user can ask a yes- or no question and get an answer,  receive a lucky number, receive a message or play a game of dice. The website is fully responsive so that the user can use it on their phone, tablet or computer.

## Features
- __The Crystal Universe Logo/Heading__

  - The logo/heading is featured at the top of the page.  
  - It is glowing to attract the attention of the user and to create a magical ambiance on the site. 
  - The blinking/glowing is set to be quite slow in order to not be too distracting for the user.

- __Navigation Bar__

  - The Navigation bar is placed under the heading and has the title for each feature in order to make it easier for the user to navigate on the site. 
  - The text in the navbar changes color if the user hovers over it to show the user that it is a clickable link.

- __The ”Ask a question”-feature__

  - This section allows the user to type a question and receive an answer.  
  - The answer is randomized just like a magic 8-ball. 
  - The question as well as the answer is printed in case the user would like to take a screenshot and share with friends. However if the user can’t be bothered to type out the question they can also just click the ask-button and receive the answer.

- __The ”Todays lucky number”-feature__
 
  - This section provides the user with a lucky number for the day. 
  - The number is randomized between 0-9999 in order for the user to be able to get angel numbers.

- __The ”Play a game”- feature__
  
  - Based on the popularity of [Bones/no bones-day](https://www.npr.org/2021/10/19/1047302978/noodles-pug-bones-no-bones-day-tiktok-mood-prediction) on TikTok, this game lets you play a game of dice against the universe to see wheatear what kind of day you will have.
  -  If the universe wins it’s a sign that you should lay low that day and if the user wins it’s a sign to seize the day.

 ### Possible Features to Implement

 - __Tarot cards__

   - This site could have a feature which gives the user one or more tarot-cards for an online reading. Since most of the other features are based on giving the user a reading of the current day, the tarot card could be a prediction of the current day. 

 - __Visuals__

   - There could be animated visuals for each feature instead of just text, for example an animated magic 8-ball for the ask-function. 

 - __Share on social media__

   - Since a lot of these features are already popular on social media, a part of the appeal is sharing the results with your friends. Therefore a feature could be a link for the user to share on social media. 

## Testing

### Responsiveness

  - The website is responsive so that it can be used on different screen-sizes. 
  - It has three media queries for different sizes: max width of 865px, max width of 600px, 425px. The width was chosen based on when the layout started to look distorted. If more features and visuals are added to the site it will mots likely need to be adjusted with more mediea queries. 
  - The responsiveness was tested using DevTools.

### Browser Testing

  - The website is tested on the commonly used browsers: Chrome, Safari, Edge, Firefox and Opera. 
  - There was a problem in Firefox where the placeholder text in the form-field wouldn't show. This was fixed by changing the color in the CSS-file. 
  - In Safari there was an issue with the google fonts that would not load. This was fixed by adding the font-weight and font-family to the textelement in the CSS-file.
